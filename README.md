## Description
We have tried gender and age detection with two face recognition ways. 

The first one with a loaded the pre-trained model of Yolo to detect Faces from github of 
[**Thanh Nguyen**](https://github.com/sthanhng/yoloface)
And the second was using HAAR cascade which was less accurate but ran faster.

For the age and gender recognition we used a method was introduced by two Israel researchers, Gil Levi and Tal Hassner in 2015. We have used the CNN models trained by them in this example.
